Simulation data

Hi, this is Zac Mayne.  

I created this repository to host the simulated learner data online so that the anyone can run the R script I generated to run the statistical analyses and generate the figures we used for this study.

Because the slashes in the file paths are incompatible in R between Mac OS and Windows (i.e., "/" and "\"), there will be two versions of the R script.
